Ability for agents to refuse to interact with other agentsThe probability that agent i will interact with agent j is proportional to some function of the reputation of the other.Spatial Prisoner’s Dilemma game in finite populations implementing existing strategiesUtilising a probabilistic model to determine movement in contrast to the existing uniform probability of movement in any given direction.Agent-specific reputation trackingThe reputation of each agent in a population (spatially or not) is known globally under the assumption that within smaller populations an assigned reputation is “widely and faithfully disseminated throughout the population” (Santos, Santos &amp; Pacheco, 2016).However in larger populations, I propose that each agent records the reputation of agents with which surrounding agents have interacted. This is in essence a simplified model for gossip in both small and large populations. For small populations, this model should produce similar results to that in which reputation is known globally.A simple example of this idea is based on the model for the spatial prisoner’s dilemma game Misc** Spelling error in Santos, Santos, PachecoPython numpy compiler and Anaconda links within link.http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/harrism/f5707335f40af9463c43
